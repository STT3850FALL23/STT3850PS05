# Background 

In this problem set, hate crimes data from the US will be used.  The FiveThirtyEight article about the data appears in the Jan 23, 2017  ["Higher Rates Of Hate Crimes Are Tied To Income
Inequality."](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/higher-rates-of-hate-crimes-are-tied-to-income-inequality/)

The crimes data will be used to run regression models with a single categorical predictor (explanatory) variable. 

## Setup{-}

First load the necessary packages: 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(moderndive)
library(readr)
```

Next, the data is read into the object `hate_crimes` from where it is stored on the web using the `read_csv()` function. 

```{r}
url <- "http://bit.ly/2ItxYg3"
if(!dir.exists("./data/")){
  dir.create("./data/")
}
if(!file.exists("./data/hate_crimes.csv")){
    download.file(url, destfile = "./data/hate_crimes.csv")}
hate_crimes <- read_csv("./data/hate_crimes.csv")
```

```{r}
glimpse(hate_crimes)
```

Be sure **ALSO** to examine the data in the viewer.

Each case/row in these data is a state in the US. The response variable we will consider is `hate_crimes`, which is the number of hate crimes per 100k individuals in the 10 days after the 2016 US election as measured by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). 

This week we will use three categorical explanatory variables in this data set: 

* `trump_support`: level of Trump support in 2016 election (low, medium or high - split into roughly equal number of cases)
* `unemployment`: level of unemployment in a state (low or high - split below or above mean)
* `median_house_inc`: median household income in the state (low or high - split below or above mean)

# Hate Crimes and Trump Support

Let's start by modeling the relationship between:

* $y$: `hate_crimes` per 100K individuals 
* $x$: Level of `trump_support` in the state: `low`, `medium`, or `high`

__________

1. Create a visual model of these data (a graph) that will allow you to conduct an "eyeball test" of the relationship between hate crimes per 100K and level of Trump support. Include appropriate axes labels and a title. Please note that because of alphanumeric ordering, the levels of `trump_support` are ordered `high`, `low`, `medium`, and hence the baseline group is `high`. Also note, that we could "reorder" the levels to `low`, `medium`, `high`....though we will leave them as is for this Problem Set. 

```{r}
# Type your code and comments inside the code chunk

```

2.  Comment on the relationship between  `trump_support`, and `hate_crimes`. Is this what you would've expected?

3. Create a model that examines the relationship between hate crime rates and the level of Trump support.  Store the results of your model in an object named `hate_mod`.  Generate a regression table using `hate_mod`.

9.  Below we calculate the group means of hate crimes for the `high`, `medium` and `low` levels of Trump support. How do these numbers compare to the three possible fitted values $\widehat{y}$ for this model?

```{r}
hate_crimes %>% 
group_by(trump_support) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hate_crimes = mean(hate_crimes, na.rm = T))
```

## The Regression Equation{-}

The regression equation for this model is the following (knit it to look at output!)


$$
\widehat{y} = 0.191 + 0.269 \times 1_{\mbox{low support}}(x) + 0.031 \times 1_{\mbox{med support}}(x)
$$

So for instance, in a state in which `trump_support` is "low" you would plug in 1 for $1_{\mbox{low support}}(x)$, and 0 in for  $1_{\mbox{med support}}(x)$ and solve as follows:

***

$$
\begin{aligned} 
\widehat{y} &= 0.191 + 0.269 \times 1 + 0.031 \times 0 \\
\widehat{y} &= 0.191 + 0.269 + 0\\
\widehat{y} &= 0.460
\end{aligned} 
$$

10. Solve the regression equation for a state in which `trump_support` is "high".

11. Which 5 states had the highest rate of hate crimes? What was the level of Trump support in these 5 states? Solve this question programmatically.

Do these results surprise you? (There is no right answer to this question.)

# Hate Crimes and Unemployment  

We will next model the relationship between: 

* $y$: `hate_crimes` per 100K individuals  after the 2016 US election 
* $x$: Level of unemployment in the state (`low`, or `high`)

***

12. Create a visual model of this data (a graph) that will allow you to conduct an "eyeball test" of the relationship between hate crimes per 100K and unemployment level. Include appropriate axes labels and a title.

```{r}
# Type your code and comments inside the code chunk

```



13. Create a model that examines the relationship between hate crime rates and the unemployment level.  Name this model `job_mod`. Generate a regression table for `job_mod`.

```{r}
# Type your code and comments inside the code chunk

```


14. Write out the regression equation for `job_mod`.
